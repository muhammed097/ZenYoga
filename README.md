Yoga Studio Website

This is a simple yoga studio website that I developed using HTML and CSS. The website is fully for my learning purposes, and I also included the UI design of my website.

The website includes the following pages:

Homepage: This page provides an overview of the yoga studio, including information about the classes offered, the instructors, and the studio's location.
Classes: This page lists all of the yoga classes offered by the studio, including the class name, the instructor, the day and time of the class, and the level of difficulty.
Instructors: This page provides information about the yoga studio's instructors, including their experience, their qualifications, and their teaching style.

Contact: This page provides contact information for the yoga studio, including the phone number, email address, and mailing address.
To view the website:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Note: This website is for learning purposes only. It is not intended to be used as a production website.

UI Design:
I also designed the UI of my website using Figma, incorporating various color variations and utilizing the Poppins font.

Feedback:
If you have any feedback on the website, please feel free to leave a comment on this repository or if you need my figma file link i will be happy to share. Reach me @ muhammedibrim97@gmail.com

Happy Coding !!!!
